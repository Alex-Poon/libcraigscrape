* There's a bug where the rdoc generates Crauigscrape weird in the package. It has to do with this not being the case in the gem:
	  * # NOTE: If you don't put libcraigscrape.rb at the beginning, the rdoc ends up looking a little screwy
      rdoc.rdoc_files.add RDOC_FILES+Dir.glob('lib/*.rb').sort_by{|a,b| (a == 'lib/libcraigscrape.rb') ? -1 : 0 } 
		* In fact, we might want to move all those requires up to the top of libcraigscrape again  once we fix this... 

* Add craigwatch object tests....

Post-0.8.2:
	* Ruby 1.9 support - respond to Jarom West (see bottom)

Post-0.8.2:
 * FEATURE: Rather then 'search/sss?query=artist+needed', maybe use CraigScrape::search_for('artist needed')
 * FEATURE: Add the craigwatch_debug feature - and monitor it... (There's a TODO in there...)
	* Shows the current progress...? (pages fetched, objects in caches..) 
 * FEATURE: Get the YAML template features working in the chris_report.yml
 	* should be pretty easy - I think we just add to the schema
 	* Might have to do this yourself with a search_templates section and an search ':include' thing
   * Should we have 'defined searches' in the yaml and then apply these defitions to a report? 
 		* It would be nice to have one search definition for 'art I want' and then allow these
	 	* to be referenced in separate reports for 'art in florida', 'art in nyc', 'art everywhere esle' ..
	 	* The other  thing I'd like to do though is have "New art watch/Classic Artwatch" type reports that look
	 	* separate - but that dont cause the crawl to happen twice. Just once with two reports per crawl..
 * FEATURE: Page-caching? Maybe? Any interest? would be nice particularly for geocaching...
 * FEATURE: Stats in the email: bytes transferred, generation time, urls scrapped, posts scrapped
 
 * FEATURE: We might want to parse the sub-locations in the geo-location code... (so for miami: brw/mia/wpb)

Hi Mr. DeRose,

I've been tinkering with your libcraigscrape library over the past few months to find things on craigslist, and recently upgraded my version of Ruby and Ruby Gems. As of this upgrade, I can't seem to make the "craigwatch" script run anymore. I really find your software very useful and wonder if perhaps maybe you have a suggestion as to where I might be going wrong. Below is the output I'm receiving.

bash-3.2$ craigwatch
/usr/local/bin/craigwatch:19:in `load': /usr/local/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems/libcraigscrape-0.7.0/bin/craigwatch:139: syntax error, unexpected ':', expecting keyword_then or ',' or ';' or '\n' (SyntaxError)
        when 'i': Regexp::IGNORECASE
                 ^
/usr/local/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems/libcraigscrape-0.7.0/bin/craigwatch:140: syntax error, unexpected keyword_when, expecting keyword_end
        when 'x': Regexp::EXTENDED
            ^

        when 'x': Regexp::EXTENDED
                 ^
/usr/local/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems/libcraigscrape-0.7.0/bin/craigwatch:141: syntax error, unexpected keyword_when, expecting keyword_end
        when 'm': Regexp::MULTILINE
            ^
/usr/local/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems/libcraigscrape-0.7.0/bin/craigwatch:141: syntax error, unexpected ':', expecting keyword_end
        when 'm': Regexp::MULTILINE
                 ^
/usr/local/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems/libcraigscrape-0.7.0/bin/craigwatch:147: syntax error, unexpected keyword_end, expecting $end
        from /usr/local/bin/craigwatch:19:in `<main>'
-bash-3.2$ 

I'm not exactly a Ruby wizard, and I'm not sure where I might be going wrong. I re-installed all the required gems to make this work and can't seem to figure out out. Maybe you have a suggestion?

A big fan,

J. West

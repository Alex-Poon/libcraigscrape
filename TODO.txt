0.8.0 TODO: 
 * Try to use some of the YAML template features to increase DRYness of the Art and Caddy watches...
	* use the 'Newlines folded' example from: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML
	* And the 'Data merge and references' to make it cleaner...
	
 * craigwatch BUG:
 	* Its possible(?) sure that these search listings are too aggressively loading posts
 		* watch what happens when you try a summary only on the fololoing?
 		* http://miami.craigslist.org/search/cta?hasPic=1&query=cadillac&s=300
 		* I actually think its not the case anymore...

 * FEATURE: Add the craidgwatch_debug featuree - and monitor it...
 
 * Start going through all the TODOs in lib and craigwatch.:

 * Go through the rdoc README and otherwise todos - 
 	* adjust the scrape_ reference(s) to use the CraigScrape.new(*paths) syntax
 	* Documentation TODO: let's just document this somewhere then: If we omit 'starting' fromt he yaml - it defaults to one day old... that right? Yea - I guess thats a sensible default.
 * craigwatch rdoc needs big revisions
 	* lsiting became sites and listings
 	* Examples should be like:
	 	south_fl = CraigScrape.new 'us/fl/miami', 'us/fl/keys'
		
		south_fl.each_listing('rea', 'search/sss?query=rack') do |listing|
			listing.each_post do |post|
				next if post.date > whatever
			end
		}
		
		south_fl.each_post('rea', 'search/sss?query=rack') do
			# Not very memory efficient
			# Should sort them by relative date! (this might actually work! )
		end
		
		south_fl.posts('rea', 'search/sss?query=rack').each do
			break if post.older_then_we_could_care_about?
		end

Post-0.8:
 * A debug_craigwatch, which shows the current progress... (pages fetched, objects in caches..)
 * Page-caching? Maybe? Any interest? would be nice particularly for geocaching...
 * Stats in the email: bytes transferred, generation time, urls scrapped, posts scrapped
 
 * We might want to parse the sub-locations in the geo-location code... (so for miami: brw/mia/wpb)
 
 * Should we have 'defined searches' in the yaml and then apply these defitions to a report? 
 	* It would be nice to have one search definition for 'art I want' and then allow these
 	* to be referenced in separate reports for 'art in florida', 'art in nyc', 'art everywhere esle' ..
 	* The other  thing I'd like to do though is have "New art watch/Classic Artwatch" type reports that look
 	* separate - but that dont cause the crawl to happen twice. Just once with two reports per crawl..

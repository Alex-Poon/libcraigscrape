The rear tires have plentyt of tread and are Michelin Pilot sports ($700 less than a year ago). The rims are staggered and are less than a year old. The car has a 2003 Mustang Cobra hood. It also has a 2003 Cobra front bumper. The paint on the car is less than a year old. The bad: The car will need 2 front tires soon. They are currently Nitto 555's. The A/C Compressor will need changing soon as it is making a little noise. It works but I dont use it just in case. The drivers side seat needs to be re-upholstered also. Minor problems considering the work that went into this car. The instrument cluster is from a Mach 1 and shows 120,000 miles, but the engine has around 70,000 miles. <br><br>\nA lot of time and money was spent on this car to do the swap right. It is my daily driver and has never given me a single problem. It's always had Mobil 1 Synthetic oil and it's plenty fast and a lot of fun to drive. If you are looking for something unique and you are a Mustang fan, you might want to consider this car.<br><br>\nThe seats are from a newer model Mustang GT. The car runs really good, and turns heads everywhere it goes, especially when I pop the hood and those in the know see the engine that doesnt belong there.  : )<br><br>\nI am will consider all offers so please don't be shy, the worse that I can do is say no. I am interested in some specific cars as well that I willl consider on trade. BMW 530 or 540, Infinity G35, Lexus IS 300 or GS300 or 400. I respond better to texts or emails.
